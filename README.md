# leva-uix

## About

This project is a rewrite of the [Leva.cljs library](https://github.com/mentat-collective/Leva.cljs) that replaces [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/) with [UIx](https://pitch-io.github.io/uix/docs/)

Much of the code in `src/leva` is unchanged from the original project. The main changes have happened in `src/leva/core.cljs` where we replace Reagent syntax with UIx syntax.

In `src/app` we run a small demo (TODO, not yet working) demo-ing the use of the UIx Leva panel.

## TODO

- [ ] get working demo with UIx, figure out how to sync atom state with React state.
